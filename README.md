# Video Pre-fetching and Caching Demo for iOS

This repository contains a demonstration of pre-fetching video URLs to play in a table view and implementing a cache system to store videos locally on the iOS platform.  

## Features 

**Video Pre-fetching:**  
  - Pre-fetching mechanism to retrieve video URLs before they are needed, ensuring smooth playback experience.

**Table View Integration:**  
  - Integration of pre-fetched video URLs with a table view to display and play videos.

**Cache System:**  
  - Implementation of a cache system to store videos locally, reducing network overhead and improving performance.

**Asynchronous Loading:**  
  - Asynchronous loading of videos to prevent blocking the main thread and enhance user experience.


## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.  

**Prerequisites**  
  - Xcode installed on your Mac.  
  - Basic understanding of iOS development using Swift.

**Installation**  
  1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/ProdevSoftware/PreFetchingVideos.git
     ```

  2. Install the pods.
  3. Open the project in Xcode by double-clicking on the .xcworkspace file.
  4. Build and run the project on a simulator or a physical device.


## Usage  

  1. Upon launching the app, you'll see a screen with button "To Player".  
  2. Tap on the button "To Player" and you'll see a table view populated with pre-fetched video URLs.  
  3. Scroll through the table view to trigger the pre-fetching mechanism.  
  4. Enjoy smooth playback and observe the caching mechanism in action.
